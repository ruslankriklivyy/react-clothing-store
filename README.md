### I was inspired by the site of the famous blogger Itpedia, and decided to make his clothing store site in React and TypeScript. Here you can browse products, add to cart, change the size of clothes or the number of clothes added, and much more.

### The technologies I used
- ReactJS
- TypeScript
- Redux / Redux Thunk
- formik
- styled-components
